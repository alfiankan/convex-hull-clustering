# Grouping Polygons (clustering) using Convex Hull

## Description
This is my rabbit hole side project to implement clustering for polygon area geometry data, this is just for proof on concept for now, but i have intention to make it as native library. I hope.

## R & D Stack
- I stored data on GeoJSON rfc standart file
- I'm using p5js to easy visualize


## Plan
1. Proof Of Concept Simple [Grouping ON_PROGRESS]
2. Proof Of Concept Dynamic Grouping [PLAN]
3. Implementing in Rust [PLAN]
4. Binding as wasm lib for JS [PLAN]
5. Binding to pyo3 for python [PLAN]
6. ....i think later [PLAN]


## How To Run
- using npx `npx server`
- open port inforned by terminal
